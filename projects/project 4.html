<p>In 1953, in a remote village in Andhra Pradesh, Subramanyam teaches dance ([Bharathanatiyam]) to his daughter, Pournami, as part of their family tradition. He recounts the story of a woman in 1507 who danced in the temple for seven days and nights to ask Lord Siva for rain during a devastating drought. The woman's sacrifice brought rain, and since then, every twelve years, a girl from her lineage performs the ritual dance in the temple. Pournami's mother performed this dance in 1951, and Pournami is expected to do the same.

In 1963, as the festival approaches, Pournami mysteriously disappears, and the villagers assume she has eloped with someone. Attention then shifts to her younger sister, Chandrakala, but their father refuses to teach her the dance. Meanwhile, their stepmother rents out their penthouse and courtyard, where Pournami used to dance, to Siva Kesava, a western-style dance instructor.

Pournami has not eloped, but her father sent her away to protect her from their zamindar, Veerabhadra, who wants to make Pournami his concubine. Fearing that the same fate might befall Chandrakala, he declines to teach her how to dance. Kesava shows a necklace to Subramanyam, which shocks him, and then promises to protect her from the zamindar. At this, she begins her studies.

As Chandrakala begins her dance training, she develops feelings for Kesava. However, Kesava reveals his past: he had married Pournami, who sacrificed herself to save his life. Before dying, she made Kesava promise that Chandrakala would perform the temple dance. After learning of her sister's fate, Chandrakala agrees to continue the tradition with her father's blessing.

Chandrakala becomes a skilled dancer, and during the festival, she performs the ritual dance. As she completes the performance, the village is once again blessed with rain. Despite Veerabhadra's interference and complications with Kesava's former fiancée, Mallika, Kesava and Chandrakala get engaged.

Years later, the couple has a daughter named Pournami, who does not want to learn the family dance. The film concludes with Kesava narrating the tradition to their daughter in the temple</p>
