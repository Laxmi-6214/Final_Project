<strong style="font-size: 20px;">🕰️ History of the Eiffel Tower:</strong>

<iframe src="https://assets.pinterest.com/ext/embed.html?id=2462974792744264" height="414" width="245" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" controls></iframe> <img src="./assets/istockphoto-639337086-612x612 eifel 2.jpg" height="414" width="345" alt="">

The Eiffel Tower was constructed between 1887 and 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World’s Fair (Exposition Universelle), which was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.
It was designed by Gustave Eiffel, a French engineer, along with his team. Initially, many artists and writers criticized the tower, calling it ugly and unnecessary. Surprisingly, it later became one of the most loved and recognizable structures in the world.
Originally, the Eiffel Tower was meant to stand for only 20 years, but its value as a radio transmission tower saved it from demolition.

<em>“What was once criticized became the pride of a nation.”</em>
